# Moodsphere: A Social Mood Journal 
Moodsphere is a mobile-friendly web application that helps users track their emotions, reflect on their mental well-being, and connect with friends and peers for support. Mental health challenges are incredibly common, yet many people struggle to find safe and accessible ways to express how they feel. Moodsphere provides an easy and supportive space to log moods, visualize emotional patterns, and share experiences within a trusted network. 
Our vision is to create a digital space that empowers users to understand their emotions and strengthen community support through self-reflection and shared well-being. We aim to make emotional wellness approachable, trackable, and socially connected.

## Project History 
MoodSphere was conceived as part of an academic project by a team of students who share a deep interest in mental health awareness and digital innovation. The idea emerged from recognizing how many people—especially students—struggle to process emotions in fast-paced, online environments that often lack genuine support.
Our team wanted to build something more personal than a standard journaling app. We envisioned a digital space where users could not only log their moods and reflections but also see meaningful insights into their emotional patterns and, if they choose, share those experiences with trusted peers.
The project combines the principles of psychology, user-centered design, and data visualization to promote mindfulness and emotional intelligence. From its initial brainstorming phase, MoodSphere has evolved through iterative sprints focused on research, wireframing, and prototype testing—all aimed at ensuring that the platform feels intuitive, safe, and empowering. Ultimately, MoodSphere represents our collective goal: to make mental-health tracking approachable, social, and supportive, while encouraging people to understand themselves and connect through shared experiences.
