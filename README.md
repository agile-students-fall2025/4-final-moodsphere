# Moodsphere: A Social Mood Journal 
Moodsphere is a mobile-friendly web application that helps users track their emotions, reflect on their mental well-being, and connect with friends and peers for support. Mental health challenges are incredibly common, yet many people struggle to find safe and accessible ways to express how they feel. Moodsphere provides an easy and supportive space to log moods, visualize emotional patterns, and share experiences within a trusted network. 
Our vision is to create a digital space that empowers users to understand their emotions and strengthen community support through self-reflection and shared well-being. We aim to make emotional wellness approachable, trackable, and socially connected.
