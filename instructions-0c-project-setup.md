# CONTRIBUTING.md
This document outlines our team norms, workflows, and contribution guidelines. 

## Team Values and Norms 
Our team is committed to collaboration, accountability, and writing clean, maintainable code. Below are our shared agreements for how we work together.

### Team Collaboration
- We communicate regularly using our group chat and scheduled meetings.
- Daily standups last 10â€“15 minutes to share progress and blockers.
- Team members are expected to respond to messages within 24 hours.
- If a member struggles with a task, they should reach out early for support.
- Conflicts are resolved through open discussion and majority consensus.

### Sprint Cadence 
- Each sprint runs for two weeks, balancing productivity with sustainability.
- Goals are reviewed at the start and end of every sprint during sprint planning and retrospectives.

### Coding Standards 
- Add code must: 
    * Be peer-reviewed before merging into 'main'.
    * Pass any existing tests and build checks. 
    * Include concise commit messages. 
    * Use clear, self documenting variable and function names. 


### Accountability 
- If a member makes no visible progress for two consecutive standups and does not communicate efficiently, the team will check in and reassign or assist as needed. 
- All team members are responsible for maintaining a respectful, supportive environment.





Begin by creating the following labels. Once you begin development, every Issue in GitHub's Issues tracker must be assigned one of these labels:

- `user story` - to be used for all user stories
- `task` - to be used for all tasks
- `spike` - to be used for all spikes.

Feel free to create other labels that are useful to your team.

### GitHub Issue milestones

Each team must have a set of Milestones to represent each Sprint within GitHub's Issues tracker:

- `Sprint 0`
- `Sprint 1`
- `Sprint 2`
- `Sprint 3`
- `Sprint 4`


## Create the initial Product Backlog

Each team must have an initial [Product Backlog](https://knowledge.kitchen/content/courses/agile-development-and-devops/slides/scrum/#46) - a set of User Stories that together define the product requirements - based on their understanding of the project so far. This will evolve as teams work on the project, but try to think through and write User Stories for as many features as you can imagine wanting to include in the project.

Each item in the Product Backlog must be added as an Issue to GitHub's Issue tracker.

Make sure you understand [how GitHub's Issue tracker works](https://knowledge.kitchen/content/courses/agile-development-and-devops/scrum/github-issues/) and attach the `user-story` label to all Issues that represent User Stories.
